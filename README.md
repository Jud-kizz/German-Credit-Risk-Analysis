# German Credit Risk Dashboard

## ðŸ“Š Overview
This repository presents a **Power BI dashboard** built from the German Credit Data.  
The dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of **loan distribution, applicant demographics, and credit risk patterns**. It enables financial analysts and decision-makers to identify trends, understand customer profiles, and assess risk levels for better credit scoring and lending strategies.
The goal of this project is to support **credit scoring analysis** and help financial institutions better understand **risk vs non-risk applicants**.

4. **Risk distribution is imbalanced** (~34% Risk vs ~66% Non-Risk), an important consideration for predictive modeling.
5. **Demographic factors such as job type, housing, and account status** show clear patterns in credit risk distribution.
